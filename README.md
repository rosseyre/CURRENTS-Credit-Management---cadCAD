# Currents Credit-Management (cadCAD)

The model leverages the cadCAD python library to simulate user transactions in a mutual credit system. A user's balance may go into negative, limited by their respective 'credit limit'. 

## Model purpose
The intention is to aid in the design of an automated credit management algorithm for a mutual credit currency ('Currents') to be built on Holochain.
